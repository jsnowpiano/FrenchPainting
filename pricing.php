    <p>At Frenchâ€™s Painting, we believe in providing exceptional value without compromising on quality. Our pricing is transparent and tailored to each project, ensuring that you get the best service at a price that fits your budget. Because every painting project is unique, we offer personalized estimates based on the size of the space, the complexity of the work, and the materials required. We are committed to offering competitive pricing while maintaining the high standards of craftsmanship you expect from us.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though we do believe that a custom pricing is best to estimate the total cost, we do see the importance of seeing estimates right away. Because of this we have created a chart that describes a simple exhibit of our pricing. We have made an example of the average room size in the USA (321 sqft)</p>
